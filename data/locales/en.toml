A simple web app to turn your creative ideas into images.
Dibujito combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image Diffusion models to help you craft beautiful images from your imagination.
A LLM analyzes your project and prompt to create an optimized version tailored to the chosen diffusion model, enhancing the generated image's aesthetics.
No need for prompt engineering: just describe what you want, and the app will handle the rest!
