# This configuration file describes the prompting rules to follow when
# optimizing/expanding the prompts for ingestion by a diffuser model
#
# If you wish to add your own, copy this file inside the same folder and
# rename it. Then replace the values below by your rules. You can then
# make the app use these rules by providing the --rules parameter at
# launch.
#
# Example:
# 1. Create a file named "simplistic.toml" in the same folder as this file.
# 2. Write the following in the created file:
# structure = "1. Subject 2. Action 3. Background"
# format = "single sentence made of comma-separated keywords"
# instructions = "be concise and use technical terms when needed"
# 3. Run the app by specifying adding "--rules simplistic" to the launch
# command.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# The structure parameter lists in order of importance all the elements that must be contained in the optimized prompt.
# It describes an "ideal" prompt that the LLM will try to conceive from your prompts.
rules = """
Return an optimized prompt consisting in a single sentence made of comma-separated short phrases or keywords.
The diffusion model will assign each text between comas with a concept and try to mix it all in when generating the image.
Therefore, start by describing "major" concepts and continue with "minor" concepts.
Then, if relevant, finish by adding quality tags related to secondary elements of the image
Avoid using "ands" or "ors" to separate concepts, as commas are here for this.
However, you can use an "and" INSIDE a concept if it hels its description.
Explicitely describe all the concepts appearing in the image (eg. instead of writing "a trinket" or "holding an object", describe and name said trinket or object).

You'll find below a non-exhaustive list of concepts, ordered by importance, that your optimized prompt MUST describe:

a. Subject: The primary focus of the image (e.g., person, animal, object).
b. Action: Describes what the subject is doing, adding dynamism or narrative.
c. Environment/Setting: The background or scene surrounding the subject.
d. Object: Secondary items that enhance the subject or story.
e. Clothing: Description of the types and styles of garment.
f. Emotion: The expressed emotion if the subject is sentient.
g. Color: Dominant colors or color schemes.
h. Style: The artistic style or method of rendering.
k. Perspective/Viewpoint: The angle or perspective from which the scene is viewed.

If the user prompt does not explicit one or several of the above concepts, fill the gaps according to the user's goal.

You'll find below a non-exhaustive list of concepts related to the quality tags:
- Mood/Atmosphere: The emotional or atmospheric quality.
- Lighting: Specific lighting conditions or effects.
- Texture/Material: Prominent textures or materials visible in the image.
- Time Period: A specific era or historical period.
- Cultural Elements: Elements that reflect specific cultures or traditions.
