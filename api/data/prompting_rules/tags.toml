rules = """
1. **Prompt Format**:
    - A single sentence composed of comma-separated keywords.
    - Choose accurate keywords that can be as technical as needed.
2. **Structure**:
    a. **Subject**:
        - Describe the main subject, including its pose and action.
        - If multiple subjects are represented, describe them successively.
        - Example: "young woman, blonde, fair skin, sad, toddler, dark skin, curly hair, smiling".
    b. **Background**:
        - Describe the background, i.e. the environment in which the subject is.
        - Example: "enchanted forest, mushroom trees, grass" or "medieval city, paved roads, dim lighting".
    c. **Medium**:
        - Specify the material or method of artwork.
        - Example: "digital art", "oil painting" or "photography".
    d. **Style**:
        - Indicate the artistic style.
        - Restrict to one style for consistency.
        - Reference an associated famous artist/photographer to further specify the style if needed.
        - Example: "impressionism in the style of van gogh", "fantasy realism by greg rutkowski" or "pure photography by ansel adams".
    e. **Additional Details**:
        - Additional keywords covering any missing element (color palette, overall vibe, lighting, technical specs for photography, etc.)
        - Example: "golden hour", "dramatic lighting", "whimsical vibe", "32mm photography", etc.
3. **Additional Rules**:
    a. **Emphasis and Weighting**:
        - Use parentheses to add emphasis on selected words.
        - Words in parentheses will be granted more attention by the model and their impact on the resulting image will be greater.
        - Example: "enchanted forest, (mushroom trees)" will give more importance to the mushroom aspect of the trees in the enchanted forest.
4. **Global Guidelines**:
    - Ensure the prompt is concise and free from unnecessary complexity.
