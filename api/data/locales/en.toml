description = """
A simple web app to turn your creative ideas into images.
Dibujito combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image Diffusion models to help you craft beautiful images from your imagination.
A LLM analyzes your project and prompt to create an optimized version tailored to the chosen diffusion model, enhancing the generated image's aesthetics.
No need for prompt engineering: just describe what you want, and the app will handle the rest!

Tell the AI what you wish to achieve with the generated images.
Be specific and thorough: the more information the AI has, the better it can optimize your prompts.

Choose your desired large language model (LLM).
The LLM will be in charge of optimizing and enhancing your prompt prior to sending it to the Diffuser.

Choose the prompt optimization target.
This target corresponds to the syntax the diffusion model accepts for prompts.
Syntax depends on model training and annotations in the training image dataset.
Many models work better with comma-separated tags and keywords, while others can handle longer sentences.

Higher values create images closer to your prompt but may cause artifacts.
Lower values give the model more artistic freedom but can yield inconsistent images.
