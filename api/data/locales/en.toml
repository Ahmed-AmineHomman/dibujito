A simple web app to turn your creative ideas into images.
Dibujito combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image Diffusion models to help you craft beautiful images from your imagination.
A LLM analyzes your project and prompt to create an optimized version tailored to the chosen diffusion model, enhancing the generated image's aesthetics.
No need for prompt engineering: just describe what you want, and the app will handle the rest!

Tell the AI what you wish to achieve with the generated images.
Be specific and thorough: the more information the AI has, the better it can optimize your prompts.

Describe what you want to see in the generated images in the "Prompt" text box.
Be detailed in your image description.

List what you do not want to see in the "Prompt (negative)" text box.
Use comma-separated keywords here.

Choose your desired text-to-image diffusion model.
The model will be downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub to your local cache when generating images.
Model download occurs only once.
"""

parameter_optimizer_description = """
Choose the prompt optimization target.
This target corresponds to the syntax the diffusion model accepts for prompts.
Syntax depends on model training and annotations in the training image dataset.
Many models work better with comma-separated tags and keywords, while others can handle longer sentences.

Determine the number of steps for the diffusion process.
More steps result in more detailed and realistic images but require longer processing times.

Set the guidance scale.
Controls how closely the diffusion model follows your prompt.
Higher values create images closer to your prompt but may cause artifacts.
Lower values give the model more artistic freedom but can yield inconsistent images.

Set a random seed for reproducibility.
Use the same seed to generate identical images with the same prompt.
Leave empty for a random seed.
