description = """
A simple web app to turn your creative ideas into images.
Dibujito combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image Diffusion models to help you craft beautiful images from your imagination.
A LLM analyzes your project and prompt to create an optimized version tailored to the chosen diffusion model, enhancing the generated image's aesthetics.
No need for prompt engineering: just describe what you want, and the app will handle the rest!

Tell the AI what you wish to achieve with the generated images.
Be specific and thorough: the more information the AI has, the better it can optimize your prompts.

Choose the strength of the prompt optimization.
"none" performs no prompt optimization.
"light" only optimizes your prompt with the chosen method (see below).
"strong" allows the LLM to invent part of the image description according to your project.

Choose the prompt optimization method.
"tags" will create prompts structured as a comma-separated list of tags & keywords whereas "descriptive" will allow the use of short sentences instead of tags.

Determine the number of steps for the diffusion process.
More steps result in more detailed and realistic images but require longer processing times.

Set the guidance scale.
Controls how closely the diffusion model follows your prompt.
Higher values create images closer to your prompt but may cause artifacts.
Lower values give the model more artistic freedom but can yield inconsistent images.
