Describe your project here.

Be specific and exhaustive: the more information the AI will know about your goal the better it will be at optimizing your prompts.
"""
generation_label="Image"
generation_description="""
Generate your images here.

Write whatever you wish to see in the generated images in the "prompt" text box.
Be descriptive and detailed in your image description.
Write as you feel it, in natural language.
Do not bother by trying to optimize your prompt as the app will optimize it for you.

Write whatever you DO NOT wish to see in the "prompt (negative)" text box.
In opposition to the "prompt" box, use comma-separated keywords here rather than long sentences.
