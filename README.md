# Dibujito

Welcome to Dibujito, a simple web app for llm-powered diffusion!

This app allows to boost your prompt via the [Command-R model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r) from [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) before sending it to [StableDiffusion 1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5). Prepare to see the best images you'll ever generate!

## Quickstart

Simply clone this repository on your system and install the dependencies specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: it is advised to first configure a virtual environment prior to installing these.

Once these dependencies are installed, you're all set! Just call the [app.py](app.py) script with your python interpreter:

```shell
python app.py
```
